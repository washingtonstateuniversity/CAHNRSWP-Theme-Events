Welcome to custom CSS for the WSU Spine Theme!

You may delete these comments and get started with your custom stylesheet.
Before doing so, please review the WSU web standards:

http://brand.wsu.edu/media/web/web-standards/

As a general rule of thumb, if your styles target aspects of the spine
(#spine), that's against standard, whereas if you're styling elsewhere on
the page, it's all good.
